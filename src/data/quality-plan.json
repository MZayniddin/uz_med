Quality reports and feedback from European partner professors are regularly prepared. Moreover, students will be involved in quality control and monitoring. Issues of monitoring will be addressed during the visits and in the interim and annual reports on the implementation of the project team. If the results of monitoring will point to the impossibility of timely achievement of the targets, it is necessary to identify the reasons for this and implement corrective measures.",
